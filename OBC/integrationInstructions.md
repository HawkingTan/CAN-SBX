### THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT DONE YET
# Summary 
THis document outlines everything that needs to get done in order to integrate the OBC with the rest of the other subsystems

# Hardware
- Raspberry pi 4 **x1**
- pi can v1 **x1**
- LED ring **x1**
- Gps **x1**
- male to male jumper wires **x15**
- 15 way ribbon cabble **x1**
- solid core wire (TO BE DETERMINED)

# OBC to ADCS integration
## GPS to ADCS Integration
### steps  
1. - [ ]  Solder 4 pieses of solid core to the GND, 3.3V, SDA and SCL (legth to be determined by the mech team)
2. - [ ]  Connect 4 wires to the ADCS arduino GND->GND,  3.3V->3.3V,  SDA->SDA, SCL->SCL
3. - [ ]  Integrate the code from the file INSET THE NAME OF THE FILE to ADCS arduino script
